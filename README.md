## Description
Go News App is a web application that displays a list of various news sources, top headlines on the landing page and world leading news caster BBC. Clicking a news article will redirect the user to read it fully from the news source. It achieves this by using the News API.

You can view the site at: <a href="https://gonewsapp.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>
